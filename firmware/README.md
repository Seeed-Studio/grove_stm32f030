# README

Here are some Arduino IDE-based firmware for Grove STM32F030.

No need to build unless you want to modify the firmware.

grove_i2c_motor_driver_stm32f030V105.bin is ready to burn. It must be used with [Grove_I2C_Motor_Driver_v1_3](../../../../Grove_I2C_Motor_Driver_v1_3) V1.05 or higher.

## Build

1. Open a `.ino` firmware in `Arduino`, select `Tool` -> `Board:` -> `Grove STM32F030`.
2. Click `Verify` button to start compiling, the path of `.bin` file can be found in log(when verbose output is enable).

## Burn SEGGER JLink/J-Flash

Connect SEGGER JLink/J-Flash to STM32F030, select device `STM32F030F4`.

## Burn ST-Link

### Hardware:
- SWC - SWCLKï¼Œ
- SWD - SWDIO
- VCC - 3V3
